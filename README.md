Search and offer (talks, workshop, project members)

Every folder has at least 2 Markdown files: `search-misc.md` and
`offer-misc.md`. Both files contain simple lists of topics. In the case of
`search-misc.md` each topic has a list of people who would like to hear about
this topic. In `Ã²ffer-misc.md` is a list of people who could offer it.

As soon as one topic has enough people being interested / somebody who could
offer it, a new Markdown file should be created for the topic.
